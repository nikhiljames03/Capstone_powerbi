# Capstone_powerbi

Situation:
We were tasked with creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a retail dataset to provide key business insights and answer critical analytical questions. This included analyzing sales, order delays, payment methods, product ratings, state-wise sales, seasonal trends, and revenue.

Task:
Design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize the data and answer the eight specific analytical questions outlined in the project requirements. This involved data modelling, creating DAX measures, and designing visually appealing and informative reports.

Action:
Data Modeling & Preparation: Imported and cleaned the retail dataset, established relationships between tables, and created calculated columns and measures using DAX to support the required analyses (e.g., total sales, delayed order flags, monthly order counts).
Report Design: Developed various visualizations including bar charts for top categories and product ratings, line charts for monthly and yearly trends, pie charts for payment methods, and maps for state-wise sales. Implemented drill-through functionality for detailed order analysis.
Dashboard Creation: Arranged the visualizations into a cohesive dashboard layout, ensuring a clear and intuitive user experience. Added interactive elements like slicers and filters to enable users to explore the data dynamically.
Testing & Refinement: Thoroughly tested the dashboard to ensure accuracy and functionality. Made adjustments based on feedback and iteratively refined the design to improve clarity and usability.

Result:
Delivered a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that addressed all eight analytical questions. The dashboard provided actionable insights into sales performance, order fulfilment, customer behaviour, and regional trends. This enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and drive business growth. The client expressed satisfaction with the dashboard's clarity, functionality, and depth of insights provided.
